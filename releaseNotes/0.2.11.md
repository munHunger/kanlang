Added file system.

```kanlang
path := "/tmp/kanlang.test" as FilePath;
msg := *FileContent as LogMsg; *LogResult;
```

Added string split

```kanlang
a := "hello world";
b := " " as SplitOperator;
for w in *[SubString] {
    msg := w as LogMsg; *LogResult;
}
```

Added string length

```kanlang
a := "hello world";
b := *StringLength;
```

Allow empty array

```kanlang
a := [] as [num];
```

can alias arrays

```kanlang
type Numbers alias [num]
```

bug fixes on the type request.
_ gives better errors when no path can be found
_ allow request in first statement after for loop \* no longer uses variables in catch as variable in request

fixed token classes to allow prefif in variable name. i.e. `input` is not a valid identifier (starts with the keyword `in`)
