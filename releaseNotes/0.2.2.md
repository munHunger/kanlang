Added boolean expression and comparison
Meaning that `if` statements makes more sense now.

This should be valid

```kanlang
(c: Celsius): NonFreezingCelsius {
    if c > 0 {
        return c as NonFreezingCelsius;
    }
    return 0 as NonFreezingCelsius;
}
```

Better validation of arguments. Meaning that you can no longer specify an arbitrary type as an argument/return.
They need to be defined first.
