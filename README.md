# kanlang

A generic programming language

read about the inception of this language [here](https://blog.wunderdev.com/blog/kanlang/1/)

## Principles

The core idea of this language is to be strongly typed and to only unique return types for all functions.
i.e. it is not allowed to have to separate functions returning a `User` object

## Output

This language is not really intended to be used anywhere, but to increase portability I have decided to compile Kanlang horizontally to javascript
